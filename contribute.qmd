# Contribute {.unnumbered}

## Join discussions

Share your industry expertise and contribute to the collective knowledge by joining our [discussions](https://github.com/phuse-org/OSTCDA/discussions). These discussions are a valuable resource, providing citable and sometimes quotable input that will culminate in a "state of the union"-style manuscript. This manuscript aims to address questions that have been sufficiently explored and to focus on those that still need attention.

We encourage you to visit the [Discussions section](https://github.com/phuse-org/OSTCDA/discussions) to share your thoughts, resources, or perspectives. If you identify a key question that has been overlooked, feel free to start a new discussion thread!

## Provide Feedback, Questions, Suggestions 

Your feedback is crucial to our progress. Please use the [Issues](https://github.com/phuse-org/OSTCDA/issues) area to share general feedback, ask questions, or make suggestions. You can also propose new paragraphs or information that you believe would be valuable for inclusion.

## Pull Requests

If you are familiar with git, we welcome you to contribute directly by submitting [Pull Requests](https://github.com/phuse-org/OSTCDA/pulls). Your contributions are highly appreciated and will help improve the manuscript.
