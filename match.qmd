## Do we need to match SAS numerically when using a different language?

-   What if we the same inputs yield similar, but numerically different results?

-   What if we the same inputs yield drastically different results?

-   What is the truth? Which is correct?

-   What if SAS and R are equivalent, but a third language yields numerical differences?
